# Vanila - React with hooks, react-use lib

Web app for searching pictures with pixaby api

import { usePrevious } from 'react-use';

I used usePrevious hook in app.js useEffect to fire scrollWindow() when page in fetchImages(query, page) is increased. When page become 0 scrollWindow() does't needed
